       This chapter provides an explanation in more details (than, say, ``contributing.md``)
       on how to contribute to the ``minterpy`` project, be it directly in the code base (e.g., features)
       or documentation (documentation contribution should be distinct).
       The main audience of the documentation is, currently at least, internal contributors.
