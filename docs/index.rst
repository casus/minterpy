######################

The python package `minterpy` is based on an optimised re-implementation of the multivariate interpolation prototype algorithm (**MIP**), given in :cite:`hecht2020`
and thereby provides software solutions that lift the curse of dimensionality from interpolation tasks.
While interpolation occurs as the bottleneck of most computational challenges, `minterpy` aims to free empirical sciences from their computational limitations. MINTERPY is continuously extended and improved by adding further functionality and modules that provide novel digital solutions to a broad field of computational challenges, including but not limited to:

**multivariate interpolation, non-linear polynomial regression, numerical integration, global (black box) optimisation, surface level set methods, non-periodic spectral PDE solvers on flat and complex geometries,
machine learning regularisation, data reconstruction, computational solutions in algebraic geometry**

`minterpy` is provided as an openSource PYTHON package that makes it easily accessable and allows further development and improvement by the PYTHON community. In the following short survey we give some crucial insights of the underlying theoretical aspects of multivariate polynomial interpolation.
