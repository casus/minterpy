Multivariate divided difference scheme (DDS)
############################################

.. todo::

   Multivariate DDS is central to the whole ``minterpy`` operation,
   it is important somehow to *demistify* it.
   In this page, all aspects related to the multivariate DDS should be defined
   and explained from the data structure used, construction, and operation.

   Provide illustrations and pictures for clarity and simple (numerical)
   examples that one can do perhaps with hand to demistify it further.
   ``minterpy`` "just" do it faster for larger problems.
