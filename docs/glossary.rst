.. todo::

   The glossary section defines all the terms that might be useful for users to know, especially if they are jargons (i.e., specific to the field and to the package itself).
   Sometimes it can be pet acronyms (you used it, very often even, just because you like it).
   It is organized into an alphabetical order. It's also about teaching users the right language of your package.

   Which terms got into the Glossary?

   - Specialized terms used in the general problem in multivariate polynomial interpolation
   - Specialized terms used in the original approach of `minterpy`
   - Other more general terms that would be useful to define to make the documentation more self contained.

   `How is it going to be used`:

   If terms are important then they should have entries in the Glossary section and this entry should be cross-referenced when the term are used across documentation (common sense applies).

   We can create a template for the entry in the Glossary section of `minterpy` documentation:

   - One (max. two) sentences summary of what the entry is
     - Use _definition tense_, i.e., don't be circular
     - Consistent capitalization
   - Cross reference (when applicable) to either:
     - the `Getting started` or `How-to Guides` sections for usage examples
     - the `Fundamentals` section for theoretical explanation
     - the `API Reference` section for code documentation
     - Wikipedia entry (only if it's a general term that is included for the sake of completeness)
