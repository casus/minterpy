How to Contribute to the Docs
#############################

This page describes the ways in you can contribute to the ``minterpy`` docs.

What to contribute
##################

We value a useful, readable, and consistent docs;
so we value your contributions to it, small and big.
Below are some examples of how you can join and help us maintain
and improve the ``minterpy`` docs:

- **General language improvements**: If you are disturbed by typos, grammatical
  mistakes, or imprecise and misleading writing (we are as well!),
  help us correct them.
- **Fixing technical errors**: If you find technical errors in the docs
  such as downright wrong statements, broken links, wrong usage examples,
  or missing parameters in the API reference, let us know about them.
- **Adding new tutorials and how-to guides**: If you think the current docs
  is missing a relevant tutorial or how-to guide, go ahead and suggest it to us.
  Or, you can also create one yourself and contribute to it.
- **Documenting new features**: If you're developing a new feature for ``minterpy``,
  we strongly encourage you to write the docs yourself including some tutorials
  and how-to guides. Note that your eventual feature contribution to the main
  branch of ``minterpy`` must include the docs. The reviews are carried out
  both for the code and the docs; we value them equally.

When you have a suggestion or thing you want to do to improve the docs,
you should open an issue in the ``minterpy`` repository (see :ref:`developers/contrib-doc/how-to-contrib:Creating an issue in the repository` below)
and describe briefly the reasoning.
This way we can track all the issues regarding the docs as well as your contributions.
Then you can wait until someone else reviews your suggestion
(and, if verified, does it for you);
or you may go ahead make the necessary changes yourself and do a merge request.
