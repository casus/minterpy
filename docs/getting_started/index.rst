Getting started with ``minterpy``
#################################

.. todo::

   Getting started is the most important part of the documentation for new users
   and developers. It should provide users what is it like to use ``minterpy``
   to solve interpolation problems.
   This chapter might be broken into parts with increasing complexity,
   progressively disclosing more difficult or specific terms related to interpolation problems or ``minterpy``  itself.

   For example:

   - Part 1: Installation
   - Part 2: One-dimensional interpolation (make sure users are convinced that it works for the most simple problems while introducing ``minterpy`` basic usage, say ``mp.interpolate``)
   - Part 3: Multi-dimensional interpolation (it works for one-dimension, it also works for higher-dimensions, introduce other aspects of ``minterpy`` not apparent in one-dimensional problem)
   - Part 4: Interpolator objects (this is also an exposed interface for users, so it might be good idea to introduce how to create and handle such objects)
