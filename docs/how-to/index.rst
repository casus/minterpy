       This chapter should provide a set of practical examples on how to achieve `common tasks`
       with ``minterpy``. We can assume that the users have some basic knowledge,
       they know what they want to achieve, they just don't know how to do it in ``minterpy``.
       Think of `recipes` when creating an entry in the How-to Guides chapter

       For examples:

       - Surface interpolation
       - Transformation between bases
       - Differentiation
