``minterpy`` is an open-source python package for multivariate generalisations of the classical Newton and Lagrange interpolation schemes as well as related tasks. It is based on an optimized re-implementation of
the multivariate interpolation prototype algorithm (*MIP*) by Hecht et al.\ :footcite:`Hecht2020`
and thereby provides software solutions that lift the curse of dimensionality from interpolation tasks.
While interpolation occurs as the bottleneck of most computational challenges,
``minterpy`` aims to free empirical sciences from their computational limitations.

``minterpy`` is continuously extended and improved
by adding further functionality and modules that provide novel digital solutions
to a broad field of computational challenges, including but not limited to:

- multivariate interpolation
- non-linear polynomial regression
- numerical integration
- global (black-box) optimization
- surface level-set methods
- non-periodic spectral partial differential equations (PDE) solvers on
  flat and complex geometries
- machine learning regularization
- data reconstruction
- computational solutions in algebraic geometry

## Installation

Since this implementation is a prototype, we currently only provide the installation by self-building from source. It is recommended to use ``git`` to get the ``minterpy`` source:
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.hzdr.de/interpol/minterpy.git
```
Within the source directory, one may use the following package manager to install ``minterpy``.

#### Using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html):
Best practice is to create an environment ``minterpy`` with the help of [conda] and the ``environment.yaml``,
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
After building the virtual environments, one need to activate it
```bash
conda activate minterpy
```
Maybe you need to `init` the conda environment. To deactivate the conda environment, just hit:
```bash
conda deactivate
```
#### using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
Installing ``minterpy`` via [pip] (in the activated environment, see above) it is also recommended to use a virtual environment (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details). To install ``minterpy``, just run
```bash
pip install [-e] .[all,dev,docs]
```
where the flag `-e` means the package is directly linked into the python site-packages of your python version (e.g. the one in the virtualenv).
The options `[all,dev,docs]` refer to the requirements defined in the `options.extras_require` section in `setup.cfg`.
One shall **not** use :code:`python setup.py install`, since one shall not assume that the file `setup.py` will be always present in further developments of ``minterpy``.

## Quickstart
With ``minterpy`` one can easily interpolate a given function. For instance, take the function :math:`f(x) = x\sin(10x)`in one spacial dimentsion:

```python

    import numpy as np
    import minterpy as mp

    def test_function(x):
        return x*sin(10*x)
```

In order to ``minterpy`` the function :code:`test_function` one can use the top-level function :code:`interpolate`:

```python

    interpolant = mp.interplate(test_function,spatial_dimension=1, poly_degree=64)
```

Here, interpolant is a callable function, which can be used as a representation of :code:`test_function`.
Beside the keyword argument :code:`spatial_dimension`, which is self-explanatory, there is the keyword :code:`poly_degree`, which denotes the degree of the underlying polynomial. Therefore, one may adjust this parameter in order to get higher accuracy. For the example above, a degree of 64 produces an interpolant which reproduces the :code:`test_function` almost up to machine precision:

```python
    import matplotlib.pylab as plt

    x = np.linspace(-1,1,100)

    plt.plot(x,interpolant(x),label="interpolant")
    plt.plot(x,test_function(x),"k.",label="test function")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
```

For a more comprehensive examples, see the [tutorial](link-to-tutorials) section of the ``minterpy`` documentation.

## Testing
After installation, it is recommended to at least run the unit tests of ``minterpy``, where we use [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) to run the tests. If you want to run all tests, just hit
```bash
pytest [-vvv]
```
within the ``minterpy`` source directory.

## Contributing to ``minterpy``
Contributions to the ``minterpy`` packages are highly wellcome. For that it is recommended to have a look on the [CONTRIBUTING.md] first. For a more complehensive contribution guide visit the [developer section](link-to-developer-section) of the documentation.
