# Changelog

# Version 0.1.0-alpha
This is the initial alpha release of `minterpy`. It contains general structures to perform the polynomial interpolation task in multiple dimensions:
* Multivariate polynomial bases (ABC + concrete implementations)
* Base transformations
* Interpolation schemes

This code is still highly experimental and there is no issuance, that neither everything works as expected, nor if further releases will break the current API.
